  CircleCI Orbs Sample List.
  I make some sample orbs and documentations.
  so maybe not to useful orb for production code.

display:
  home_url: "https://github.com/tarappo"
  source_url: "https://github.com/tarappo/sample-orb"

# If your orb requires other orbs, you can import them like this. Otherwise remove the "orbs" stanza.
# orbs:
#  hello: circleci/hello-build@0.0.5
